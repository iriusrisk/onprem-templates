# IriusRisk On-Prem Automation Setup

This repository includes **automation scripts** to fully set up an IriusRisk on-prem deployment on a fresh server.  
They install dependencies, configure PostgreSQL, generate certificates, and deploy containers via Docker or Podman in rootless mode.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning**  
These scripts are intended to be run on a **completely fresh machine**.  
If an existing PostgreSQL installation (standalone, containerized, or otherwise) is present on the **same machine**, and you choose to set up PostgreSQL on the same machine, these scripts will either:

- Fail with errors, **or**
- Wipe the existing PostgreSQL setup, including its databases.

Do **not** run these scripts on a machine that already has a PostgreSQL database you care about.

## üîÄ Quickstart Flow

```text
   Fresh server
        ‚îÇ
        ‚ñº
   bootstrap.sh   (or one-click.sh if repo already cloned)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ preflight.sh    (checks dependencies & environment)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ setup-wizard.sh (asks questions, updates configs)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ full deployment (DB + services + containers)
```

- **Use `bootstrap.sh`** on a brand-new machine.  
- **Use `one-click.sh`** if you‚Äôve already cloned the repo and are in `scripts/`.  
- `preflight.sh` and `setup-wizard.sh` can be run standalone for checks/configuration.

## üìÇ Automation Scripts Overview

### `bootstrap.sh`
- Simplest entrypoint for a brand-new server.
- Installs `git` if missing, clones this repository, and launches `one-click.sh`.
- Best for **remote installations** where nothing is pre-installed.

### `one-click.sh`
- The main **end-to-end installer**.
- Ensures you‚Äôre in the right directory, picks a container engine (Docker or Podman), sets up PostgreSQL (internal container, external DB, or local install), and then deploys IriusRisk.
- Calls other helper scripts (`preflight.sh`, `setup-wizard.sh`) as needed.
- Recommended if you‚Äôve already cloned the repo and are inside the `scripts/` directory.

### `setup-wizard.sh`
- Runs interactively and asks questions about:
  - PostgreSQL setup (internal, external, or host-installed)
  - Hostname and external URLs
  - SAML integration
- Updates configuration files accordingly.
- Can be run standalone if you want to just configure and not deploy.

### `preflight.sh`
- Runs environment checks.
- Detects missing dependencies (git, Java, psql, jq, container engine).
- Reports warnings (e.g., missing SAML keystore passwords).
- Exits with error if critical requirements are unmet.
- Safe to run standalone for validation before a real install.

## üöÄ Typical Workflow (Fresh Setup)

1. **Provision a new Linux VM** (RHEL 9+, CentOS-based, Debian-based, or AWS Linux-based).  
   Ensure you have sudo privileges.

2. **Run the bootstrap installer**:
   ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iriusrisk/onprem-templates/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh -o bootstrap.sh
    chmod +x bootstrap.sh
    ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Install `git` if needed
   - Clone this repository
   - Launch `one-click.sh`

3. **Answer interactive prompts**:
   - Choose container engine (`docker` or `podman`)
   - Decide how to set up PostgreSQL (internal container, external DB, or install locally)
   - Provide hostname
   - Confirm deployment

4. **Deployment starts**:
   - Dependencies are installed
   - PostgreSQL is set up
   - Configuration is applied
   - Containers are deployed
   - Systemd services are created (so containers restart automatically on reboot)

5. **Post-deployment (Docker only)**:  
   If Docker was chosen as the container engine, the installer will add your user to the `docker` group.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è You must **log out and log back in** (or start a new shell session) before running Docker commands manually.  
   Until you do, manual Docker commands will fail with `permission denied` errors.

---

## üß∞ Advanced / Standalone Usage

- **Check environment before running full install**:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/preflight.sh
  ```

- **Run configuration wizard only**:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/setup-wizard.sh
  ```

- **Run one-click manually (if repo already cloned)**:
  ```bash
  cd onprem-templates/scripts
  ./one-click.sh
  ```

---

## üìò Additional Notes

- **Certificates**: Self-signed certs are generated automatically if not provided.  
  Place your `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, and `ec_private.pem` in `docker/` or `podman/` depending on your chosen engine, if using custom ones. For production environments, it is **highly recommended** to provide your own securely signed certificates.
- **Systemd integration**: Docker and Podman services are wrapped as systemd units so the stack comes up automatically after a reboot.
- **Rootless Podman**: The automation configures rootless Podman correctly (including `/run/user/<uid>` handling, tmpfiles rules, and environment exports).
- **Logs**: All scripts log their output under `logs/` with filenames like  
  `one-click_2025-08-29_12-34-56.log`. Child scripts append to the same log automatically.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Docker "Permission Denied" Errors
- **Error**: `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`  
- **Cause**: Your user has just been added to the `docker` group, but the session hasn‚Äôt refreshed.  
- **Fix**:  
  Log out and log back in, or run:  
  ```bash
  newgrp docker
  ```  
  After this, manual Docker commands should work without `sudo`.

---

### PostgreSQL Port Already in Use
- **Error**: `rootlessport listen tcp 0.0.0.0:5432: bind: address already in use`  
- **Cause**: Another PostgreSQL instance (container or host) is already using port 5432.  
- **Fix**:
  ```bash
  podman ps | grep postgres
  systemctl status postgresql
  ```
  Stop or remove any conflicting instance before re-running.

---

### Boot ID Mismatch Error (Podman)
- **Error**:  
  ```
  Error: current system boot ID differs from cached boot ID;
  Please delete directories "/tmp/storage-run-1000/containers" ...
  ```
- **Cause**: Podman falling back to `/tmp` for runtime dirs, which resets on reboot.  
- **Fix**: The automation now creates **symlinks** so `/tmp/storage-run-<uid>` always maps into `/run/user/<uid>`.  
  If you still see this:
  ```bash
  rm -rf /tmp/storage-run-$(id -u)/*
  podman ps
  ```

---

### Missing `/run/user/<uid>` After Reboot
- **Error**: `Failed to obtain podman configuration: lstat /run/user/1000: no such file or directory`  
- **Cause**: User systemd session not running or linger not enabled.  
- **Fix**:
  ```bash
  sudo loginctl enable-linger $(id -un)
  sudo loginctl start-user $(id -un) || true
  ```
  Then re-login or reboot.

---

### Systemd "No medium found"
- **When seen**: Running `systemctl --user ...` inside a fresh SSH session.  
- **Cause**: Session bus env vars not exported.  
- **Fix**: The automation installs `/etc/profile.d/10-xdg-user-bus.sh`, which exports:
  ```bash
  export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
  export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/bus
  export TMPDIR=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}
  ```
  Log out and back in to pick this up.
